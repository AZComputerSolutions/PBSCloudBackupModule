Description
===========

This tool will help you to detect common pitfalls and misconfiguration before,
and during the upgrade of a Proxmox Backup Server system. Any failures or
warnings must be addressed prior to the upgrade. If you suspect that a message
is a false positive, you have to make carefully sure that it really is.
